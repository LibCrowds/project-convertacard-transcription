Currently, the only way to discover thousands of the printed books held in our
collections is to manually flick through huge card catalogues held at the British Library.
It is our hope, with your help, to transform these printed cards into electronic
records for inclusion in our online catalogue, [Explore](http://explore.bl.uk/).


### The task

On the next page you will be presented with a digitised image of a printed card
catalogue record and asked to transcribe the information found on that card.

The cards will often contain text in non-romanised scripts and therefore require
specialist language knowledge in order to be correctly transcribed.

You can find more detailed guidance on the [tutorial page](./tutorial), please
do read through this before starting and refer to it as necessary if you're unsure
about how any data should be entered into any of the fields.
