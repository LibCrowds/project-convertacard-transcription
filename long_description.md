Currently, the only way to discover thousands of the printed books held in our
collections is to manually flick through huge card catalogues held at the British Library.
It is our hope, with your help, to transform these printed cards into electronic
records for inclusion in our online catalogue, [Explore](http://explore.bl.uk/).


### The task

On the next page you will be presented with a digitised image of a printed card
catalogue record and asked to transcribe the information found on that card.

The cards will often contain text in non-romanised scripts and therefore require
specialist language knowledge in order to be correctly transcribed.

While the form is rather long, many of the cards will actually contain very
little information. You only need to fill in the fields according to what
information is visible on the card, leaving any other fields blank.

You can find more detailed guidance on the [tutorial page](./tutorial). Please
read through this before starting and refer to it as necessary if you're unsure
about how to fill in any of the fields.
